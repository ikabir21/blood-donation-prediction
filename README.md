# Vital Donor: Blood Donation Predictor
Blood donation camps play a vital role in addressing this issue as they serve as major sources for blood collection. However, a significant challenge arises when it comes to convincing individuals to participate in blood donation. Consequently, this leads to wastage of valuable resources. Vital Donor overcomes this challenge by an advanced machine learning model. 

Vital Donor focuses on optimizing the efficiency of blood donation camps by proactively engaging the right individuals beforehand. At the core of our approach lies the Blood Donation Predictor, which harnesses the power of machine learning algorithms to analyze the donation patterns of individuals. By studying these patterns, the model calculates the probability of a person donating blood. The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset of past donors, enabling accurate predictions. Individuals have the opportunity to create surveys, allowing them to gather essential information about the blood donation history of potential donors. 

Leveraging this data, the Blood Donation Predictor calculates the probability of each person donating blood during the current time window. Armed with these insights, organizers can effectively contact the individuals most likely to donate, thereby enhancing the success of the donation camp.
